# ActiveStorage::Service::DirectDiskService

There was a lot of talks if it's good or bad to have permanent static links for your uploads.
This gem gives you and option of good old nginx/apache/other-public-server files serving.

Add this to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'activestorage_direct_disk'
```

And this to your `config/storage.yml`:

```
test:
  service: DirectDisk
  root: 'storage_test'

local:
  service: DirectDisk
  root: 'storage'
```

And you are done!

As you can see, it stores all the files in the subfolder of your app's `public` folder, that you specify with `root` configuration key. All URLs generated by the application will point right to the static file, that can be served directly by nginx. Other behavior is the same as the original `Disk` Service.
